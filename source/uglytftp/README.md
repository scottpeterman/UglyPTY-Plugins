# TFTP Server Application

This repository is a fork of the [TFTP server application](https://github.com/msoulier/tftpy) by [msoulier](https://github.com/msoulier). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling and monitoring a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server.

## Overview

The TFTP Server Application is built using PyQt6 and tftpy libraries. It allows you to easily set up a TFTP server to serve files from a specified folder. The GUI provides options to start and stop the server, browse and select the serving folder, and view log messages in real-time.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive graphical interface.
- Easily configure the folder from which files are served.
- Start and stop the TFTP server with the click of a button.
- Real-time log messages displayed in the GUI.
