# PyQt6 Click Command Runner

## Overview

The PyQt6 Click Command Runner is a GUI tool designed to dynamically create form fields based on Python Click commands and execute them. Built using the PyQt6 library, this application provides a user-friendly interface for running Python Click scripts. Instead of running Click commands from the command-line interface, you can use this GUI to fill out options and execute them.

## Features

- **Choose Python Click Script**: Open a file dialog to choose a Python Click script.
- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Automatically populate form fields based on the selected script's Click parameters.
- **Run Button**: Execute the script with the specified parameters.
- **Output Display**: View the script output (stdout and stderr) in a text box.
- **Command Display**: View the full command string generated based on the provided options.

## Requirements

- PyQt6
- Python 3.x

## How It Works

1. **Choose Script Button**: Upon clicking this button, a file dialog opens, letting the user choose a Python script. The script is then parsed to identify its Click parameters, which in turn generates corresponding form fields.

2. **Form Fields**: After selecting a script, the application automatically creates form fields based on the script's Click parameters. Fill in the desired values here.

3. **Run Button**: Clicking this button will run the selected script with the filled-in parameters. It utilizes a `QProcess` object to manage and execute the external script.

4. **Command Display**: The generated command is displayed in a read-only text field for user reference.

5. **Output Display**: A text box is available to display the output (stdout and stderr) of the executed script.

## Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Click on "Choose Click Script" to select the Python Click script you want to run.
3. Fill in the generated form fields with the parameters for your script.
4. Click the "Run" button to execute the script.
5. Monitor the script's output in the text box below the "Run" button.

## Limitations

- No input validation for dynamically generated fields.
- No handling for required Click parameters.
- Does not currently support Click commands that have subcommands.
